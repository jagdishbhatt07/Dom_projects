                            The earliest noted adventures of humans with coding take us back to 60 A.D. Heron of
                            Alexander was a Greek mathematician and engineer. He invented the machine that was used to
                            control puppets with the help of strings. The machine could be reprogrammed by rearranging
                            the strings to make the puppets do different things.

                            Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many
                            different skills and tools. They also help build software systems that power networks and
                            devices and ensure that those systems remain functional.
